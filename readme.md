# Tea Time Topic
 
## The structure of my files
- Creating the html in the html file
- The `script.js` file is the entry point for all js-files
 
## Structure of my project
- I fetched the data from the server
- I have a function called `GenerateHtml` to generate the html for this project
- The function `displayTopic` displays the list of topics in the document
- The `addTopic` function enables the users to add a new topic

- I used the function `handleClick` in order to encrement and decrement the scores as well as as to delete

## What could be improved
- Working on the archive and using different files for the js-files
# My experience
- It's difficult for me to import files
- I cleared the local storage and they deleted forever
- The local storage would work if I uncomment the dispatch event but the problem is I have cleared it so I don't want the list t be empty.
- Working on the sort is quite complicated
## What I have learned
- Never clear the local storage if you don't know how to restore it.
